# Active Directory Lab

## Objective
The objective of creating an Active Directory lab is to provide a controlled environment for learning and experimenting with Active Directory configurations, security practices, and administrative tasks. This lab allowed me to gain hands-on experience with directory services, improve my understanding of user and group management, and analyze logs for security events, ultimately enhancing my skills in managing and securing an Active Directory infrastructure.

### Skills Learned
- User and Group Management: Create, modify, and manage user accounts and groups within Active Directory.
- Active Directory Configuration: Set up and configure Active Directory Domain Services, including domain controllers and organizational units.
- Group Policy Management: Implement and manage Group Policies to control user and computer settings across the network.
- Authentication and Authorization: Understand and configure authentication mechanisms and authorization settings to secure resources.
- Backup and Recovery: Perform backup and recovery operations to ensure the availability and integrity of Active Directory data.
- Troubleshooting: Diagnose and resolve common Active Directory issues to maintain a healthy and functional directory service.
